### Day 5: May 16, 2020

#### Today's Progress

Today I went back to the basic on CSS and started [CSS In-Depth, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/css-in-depth-v2/) by Estelle Wely. Today's coursework focused on the nuances of CSS selectors including, Relational selectors and combinators, attribute selectors, pseudo selectors, and structural selectors.

#### Thoughts

Revisiting some of the 'basics' of CSS reminds me of the importance of the fundamentals. I find I always learn a thing or two from introductory material and Estelle's course is no exception. I wasn't expecting to spend the first 2 hours of the course focusing on selectors but it's been a while since I focused on CSS so it's time well spent.
