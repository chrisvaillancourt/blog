### Day 5: May 16, 2020

#### Today's Progress

Today I went back to the basic on CSS and started [CSS In-Depth, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/css-in-depth-v2/) by Estelle Wely. Today's coursework focused on the nuances of CSS selectors including, Relational selectors and combinators, attribute selectors, pseudo selectors, and structural selectors.

#### Thoughts

Revisiting some of the 'basics' of CSS reminds me of the importance of the fundamentals. I find I always learn a thing or two from introductory material and Estelle's course is no exception. I wasn't expecting to spend the first 2 hours of the course focusing on selectors but it's been a while since I focused on CSS so it's time well spent.

#### Work examples

##### Attribute selectors

Attribute selectors are used to select elements based on their current attribute values. Attribute selectors have the same specificity as a class so it's important to keep [CSS specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity) in mind.

Attribute selectors have the following structure: `element[attribute]`. We can select an element by it's attribute and/or it's associated value: `E[attr="val"]`. This would select element `E` whose attribute `attr` has the exact, case-sensitive, value `val`.

Here are a few other attribute selector examples:

```css
/* ---------- Example #1 ---------- */
E[attr|=val] {
  /* element E with an attr value of val or val- */
  /* useful for selecting based on language (see next example) */
}

p[lang|="en"]{
  /* <p lang="en-us"> <p lang="en-uk">*/
}

/* ---------- Example #2 ---------- */

E[attr^=val]{
  /* Element E whose attribute attr starts with the value val */


}

a[href^=mailto] {background-image: url(emailicon.gif);}
/* When printing, show url of external links */
@media print{
  abbr[title]:after {
    content: "(" attr(title) ")";
  }
  a[href^=http]:after {
    content: "(" attr(href) ")";
  }
}
/*
 In CSS, we can show the attribute value with attr(...)
*/

/* ---------- Example #3 ---------- */

E[attr$=val]{
  /* element E whose attribute attr ends with val */
}

/* useful for matching PDF and providing contextual info for the user */
a[href$=pdf] {background-image: url(pdficon.gif);}
a[href$=pdf]:after {content: " (PDF)";}

/* ---------- Example #4 ---------- */
E[attr*=val]{
  /* String val is anywhere in the content */
}

/* ---------- Example #5 ---------- */
E[attr~=val] {
  /* full word val  */
}
```
