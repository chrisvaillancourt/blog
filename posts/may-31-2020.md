### Day 18: May 31, 2020

#### Today's Progress

Today I added user interaction to a bar, line, and scatter chart with D3.

#### Thoughts

It's near impossible to think about tech in the context of the state of the world. Never the less, today was a good reminder of the different approaches to adding chart interactions.

#### Work examples
