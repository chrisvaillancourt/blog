### Day 4: May 15, 2020

#### Today's Progress

Today I continued through [Functional-Light JavaScript](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/functional-javascript-v3/) and completed sections for recursion and list operations.

#### Thoughts

Functional programming is turning out to be a lot more complex than originally anticipated. I still like working through the concepts but the challenges are tough to complete.
