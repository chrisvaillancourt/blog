### Day 5: May 16, 2020

#### Today's Progress

Today I scratched the surface of monads in [Functional-Light JavaScript](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/functional-javascript-v3).

#### Thoughts

Yesterday was the first day I failed to code and tweet my progress. I still coded but need to work on staying consistent, even if the progress is slow and steady.

I really like the core principles of functional programming and I'm excited to use them more in my day-to-day. Monads are still relatively abstract so I'm hoping to see examples of when they are a good option to use.
