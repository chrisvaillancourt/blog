### Day 3: May 14, 2020

#### Today's Progress

Today I completed closure, composition, and immutability from Kyle's [Functional-Light JavaScript](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/functional-javascript-v3/). 

#### Thoughts

I didn't *really* know what functional JavaScript was all about and but now I have a hint. I wish I could say it came easier than it did but I know it will come with time.

#### Work examples

##### Closure

Closure is when a function 'remembers' the variables around it even when that function is executed elsewhere. If we leverage closure in functional programming, we have to be sure we're closing over non-changing (mutating) values:

```js
'use strict';
function makeCounter() {
  var counter = 0;
  return function increment() {
    return ++counter;
  };
}
var c = makeCounter();

// c is not a pure function because passing the same inputs
// produces different outputs
c(); // 1
c(); // 2
c(); // 3
```

```js
// we have closure over z which is a constant
function addAnother(z) {
  return function addTwo(x, y) {
    return x + y + z;
  };
}
var add1 = addAnother(1);
console.log(add1(2, 3)); // 6
```
