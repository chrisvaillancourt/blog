### Day 3: May 14, 2020

#### Today's Progress

Today I completed closure, composition, and immutability from Kyle's [Functional-Light JavaScript](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/functional-javascript-v3/). 

#### Thoughts

I didn't *really* know what functional JavaScript was all about and but now I have a hint. I wish I could say it came easier than it did but I know it will come with time.

#### Work examples

##### Closure

Closure is when a function 'remembers' the variables around it even when that function is executed elsewhere. If we leverage closure in functional programming, we have to be sure we're closing over non-changing (mutating) values:

```js
'use strict';
function makeCounter() {
  var counter = 0;
  return function increment() {
    return ++counter;
  };
}
var c = makeCounter();

// c is not a pure function because passing the same inputs
// produces different outputs
c(); // 1
c(); // 2
c(); // 3
```

```js
// we have closure over z which is a constant
function addAnother(z) {
  return function addTwo(x, y) {
    return x + y + z;
  };
}
var add1 = addAnother(1);
console.log(add1(2, 3)); // 6
```

Closure challenge:

1. Modify `strBuilder(..)` so that it can take a string and return back a function.

**Note:** For purposes of this exercise, assume that `strBuilder(..)` itself is always called with a string initially.

2. For each call to a function here, if a string is passed, a function should be returned.

3. If a non-string is passed (such as passing no argument), a string value should be returned, which is the concatenation of all the passed in strings.

4. Hints:

- You can use `typeof foo == "string"` to test if `foo` is a string.

- Look at the test cases at the bottom of the exercise file to clarify any questions about expected behavior.

- Ensure your function(s) are pure. Avoid mutating a closed over variable, which would be a side-effect.

Solution:

```js
'use strict';

// we can't do it this way because we mutate str
// function strBuilder(str) {
//   return function next(v) {
//     if (typeof v == 'string') {
//       str += v;
//       return next;
//     }
//     return str;
//   };
// }

// Here, we have closure over str and we never mutate it
function strBuilder(str) {
  return function next(v) {
    if (typeof v == 'string') {
      return strBuilder(str + v);
    }
    return str;
  };
}

// ---------------------------------------------
var hello = strBuilder('Hello, ');
var kyle = hello('Kyle');
var susan = hello('Susan');
var question = kyle('?')();
var greeting = susan('!')();

console.log(strBuilder('Hello, ')('')('Kyle')('.')('')() === 'Hello, Kyle.');
console.log(hello() === 'Hello, ');
console.log(kyle() === 'Hello, Kyle');
console.log(susan() === 'Hello, Susan');
console.log(question === 'Hello, Kyle?');
console.log(greeting === 'Hello, Susan!');
```
