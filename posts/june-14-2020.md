### Day 31: June 14, 2020

#### Today's Progress

Today I finished this [marginal histogram](https://chrisvaillancourt.github.io/d3-examples/marginal-histogram/) and started a [radar chart](https://chrisvaillancourt.github.io/d3-examples/radar-weather-chart/).

#### Thoughts

When working with SVG, it's important to keep in mind the drawing order of elements. You can create and append elements earlier in your chart setup to layer other elements (like chart axes) behind elements you append later. The [radar chart](https://chrisvaillancourt.github.io/d3-examples/radar-weather-chart/) is a good example of drawing peripheral chart elements before we draw data elements,

Quick D3 tip: [d3 time intervals](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/tree/v1.1.0) `range()` method can be used to create a list of datetime objects spaced by a specified interval (like a list of months in a year).

#### Work examples
