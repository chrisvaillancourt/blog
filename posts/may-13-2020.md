### Day 1: May 13, 2020

#### Today's Progress

Today I completed Kyle Simpson's [JavaScript: The Recent Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/js-recent-parts/) and started his other course, [Functional-Light JavaScript, v3](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/functional-javascript-v3/).

#### Thoughts

Working through the regular expressions section of Recent Parts was...work. I don't have a need to use reg ex in my day-to-day and it's been too long since I first learned them on [freeCpdeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

I really enjoyed learning about async generators but I'll need to work with them more before I feel comfortable using them.

Kyle's [Functional-Light course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/functional-javascript-v3/) is a great intro to the functional paradigm and I feel so grateful for his course on the topic. His topics on *function purity* and *argument adapters* clicked right away but went downhill quick when we hit *point free* functions.

#### Work examples

##### Async challenge
