### Day 2: May 13, 2020

#### Today's Progress

Today I completed Kyle Simpson's [JavaScript: The Recent Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/js-recent-parts/) and started his other course, [Functional-Light JavaScript, v3](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/functional-javascript-v3/).

#### Thoughts

Working through the regular expressions section of Recent Parts was...work. I don't have a need to use reg ex in my day-to-day and it's been too long since I first learned them on [freeCpdeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

I really enjoyed learning about async generators but I'll need to work with them more before I feel comfortable using them.

Kyle's [Functional-Light course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/functional-javascript-v3/) is a great intro to the functional paradigm and I feel so grateful for his course on the topic. His topics on *function purity* and *argument adapters* clicked right away but went downhill quick when we hit *point free* functions.

#### Work examples

##### Regular Expressions dotall mode

```js
'use strict';
var msg = `
The quick brown fox
jumps over the
lazy dog`;
msg.match(/brown.*over/); // null because .* won't match across multiple lines
msg.match(/brown.*over/s);
```

##### Async challenge

we want to request a series of files concurrently but we don't want to print them in the specific order we requested them. We also want to print them as soon as they come back (so we can't use `Promise.all()` to wait for all of the promises to resolve.

Solution:

```js
'use strict';
function getFile(file) {
  return new Promise(function (resolve) {
    fakeAjax(file, resolve);
  });
}

async function loadFiles(files) {
  const promises = files.map((file) => getFile(file));
  for (let promise of promises) {
    console.log(await promise);
  }
}

loadFiles(['file1', 'file2', 'file3']);

// **************************************

function fakeAjax(url, cb) {
  var fake_responses = {
    file1: 'The first text',
    file2: 'The middle text',
    file3: 'The last text',
  };
  var randomDelay = (Math.round(Math.random() * 1e4) % 8000) + 1000;

  console.log('Requesting: ' + url);

  setTimeout(function () {
    cb(fake_responses[url]);
  }, randomDelay);
}
```

##### Async generators with yield

Example of fetching data from a list of URL's and pusing the responses as they come back. Lazy pushing allows lazy consumption.

```js
'use strict'
async function *fetchURLs(urls){
  for(let url of urls){
    let resp = await fetch(url);
    if (resp.status == 200) {
      let text = await resp.text();
      yield text.toUpperCase();
    } else {
      yield undefined;
    }
  }
}
```

##### Lazy async iteration

Calling an `async` generator returns a special type of iterator that allows us to consume data as they become available. We can't really use a `for...of` loop with an async generator because the async iterator returns a promise for an iterator, not the result itself.

```js
'use strict';
async function main(favoriteSites) {
  var it = fetchURLS( favoriteSites ); // fatchURLS is a generator that returns an iterator
  while(true) {
    let res = await it.next();
    if (res.done) break;
    let text = res.value;
    console.log( text )
  }
}
```

Writing that code is less than ideal so they added the `for await...of` loop for async iteration. This allows us to await the iterator result before moving on to continue the iteration:

```js
'use strict';
async function main(favoriteSites) {
  for await (let text of fetchURLs( favoriteSites )) {
    console.log(text)
  }
}
```
