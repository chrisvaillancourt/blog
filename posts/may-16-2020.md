### Day 5: May 16, 2020

#### Today's Progress

Today I continued through [Functional-Light JavaScript](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/functional-javascript-v3/) and learned about transduction and generic data structure operations.

#### Thoughts

Sticking to 100DaysOfCode on the weekend is much harder when you aren't in the workday rhythm. I'm someone who *needs* consistent routines to stay on track so I'm going to have to develop a weekend coding routine.

I find it especially difficult to get into the right headspace so my best bet might be to coding first before relaxing.

Regarding today's material, transduction is every bit as complicated as I was expecting. I'm going to have to revisit the topic and code up my own example to better understand what's going on.
