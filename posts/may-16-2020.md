### Day 5: May 16, 2020

#### Today's Progress

Today I continued through [Functional-Light JavaScript](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/functional-javascript-v3/) and learned about transduction and generic data structure operations.

#### Thoughts

Sticking to 100DaysOfCode on the weekend is much harder when you aren't in the workday rhythm. I'm someone who *needs* routine to stay on track so I'm going to need to create a weekend coding routine.

Regarding today's material: transduction is every bit as complicated as I was expecting. I'm going to have to revisit the topic and code up my own example to better understand what's going on.

#### Work examples

##### Transduction

Transduction is the process of composing `map()`, `filter()`, and/or `reduce()`.

We can't do a basic composition of `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` because each of those functions have a different shape (*Function shape*: the number and kinds of things you pass into it as well as the number and kinds of things that come out of it). `map`'s shape is one value in, one value out. `filter`'s shape is single value in, boolean value out. `reduce` takes two inputs, an accumulator and current value.

The plus side of transduction is we don't necessarily need to know what's going on behind the scenes with transduction to use it to our advantage. If we need to compose a `map()`, `filter()`, and/or `reduce()`, then we know we can use `transduce()`.

Transduction reshapes `map()` and `filter` into the shape of reduce so we can compose them together. The reduce versions of `map()` and `filter()` are a bit different than the `reduce()` we're used to - it's actually a higher order reducer (a reducer function that takes a reducer function as a parameter).

Here's transduction in code:

```js
'use strict';

function divBy(v) {
  return function divide(num) {
    return num / v;
  };
}

function mulBy(v) {
  return function multiply(num) {
    return num * v;
  };
}

function addBy(v) {
  return function add(num) {
    return num + v;
  };
}

function sum(total, v) {
  return total + v;
}

function compose(...fns) {
  return function composed(arg) {
    return fns.reduceRight((result, fn) => fn(result), arg);
  };
}
function isOdd(v) {
  return v % 2 == 1;
}

var div3 = divBy(3);
var mul2 = mulBy(2);
var add1 = addBy(1);

var list = [1, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 13, 16, 21];

// we'd like to compose these together but we can't with our existing compose function
var result = list.map(add1).filter(isOdd).reduce(sum);

// console.log(result); // 42

// manual transduction

var manualResult = list.reduce(function allAtOnce(total, v) {
  v = add1(v);
  if (isOdd(v)) {
    total = sum(total, v);
  }
  return total;
}, 0);

console.log(manualResult); // 42

// naive (maybe?) implementations of map() and filter() with a reducer

// mapWithReduce mutates the arr parameter which would normally be a no no
// but we can do it because it ultimately doesn't matter with transduction.
// The math behind transduction makes the mutation not matter (1) and (2)
// transduction is all about performance and creating a new array and appending
// values wouldn't be as performant.

function mapWithReduce(arr, mappingFn) {
  return arr.reduce(function reducer(list, v) {
    list.push(mappingFn(v)); //mutation
    return list;
  }, []);
}
function filterWithReduce(arr, predicateFn) {
  return arr.reduce(function reducer(list, v) {
    if (predicateFn(v)) {
      list.push(v);
    }
    return list;
  }, []);
}
// If we used a FP lib, mapReducer() and filterReducer() would be provided.
// mapReducer() reshapes the mapper to be a reducer.
// filterReducer() reshapes filter to be a reducer.
// The result of these is a special reducer.
// This special reducer needs a reducer to be passed to it in order to become a reducer

// transducer will become a reducer if passed a reducer
var transducer = compose(
  mapReducer(add1),
  filterReducer(isOdd)
)

// transduce() would be provided by a functional lib
// Behind the scenes, transduce passes sum into transducer as a reducer, producing a composed reducer
// it then reduces the list with the new reducer
transduce(
  transducer,
  sum, // reducer
  0, // initial value
  [1, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 13, 16, 21] // data passed in
)

// into is another helper that is usually provided by FP libs
// into automatically provides us the sum function from earlier
// into looks at the initial data value and implies the combinator to use.
// If we passed in a string, into would've done string concatenation.
// If passed an array, would do an array push combinator

into(transducer, 0, [1, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 13, 16, 21])
```
