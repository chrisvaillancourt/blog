For the next 100 days, I will 1. code for 1-hour (minumum), 2. [tweet](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysOfCode) my progress with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag, and 3. post my work for others to see.

### Day 1: May 12, 2020

#### Today's Progress

Took Kyle Simpson's [JavaScript: The Recent Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/js-recent-parts/) and learned about new features of ES2016 - ES2019. We learned about template strings, tagged templates, array & object destructuring, iterators, and generators. Tomorrow, I plan to finish sections on regular expressions and Async Await. I also revamped *this* blog to be the home for this challenge.

#### Thoughts

Something Kyle is good at is contextualizing information. He does a great job of giving you enough information to know what makes a new feature special and the old (imperative) approaches to JavaScript.

#### Work examples

##### Array Destructuring

A rest operator will give us an empty array if there isn't any data to collect:

```js
function data() {
  return [1, 2, 3];
}

var [first, second, third, ...fourth] = data();

console.log(fourth); // logs []
```

Sometimes you want to collect a reference to the original data and destructure it:

```js
function data() {
  return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
}
var temp;
var [first, second, third, ...rest] = (temp = data());
console.log(temp); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

Use array destructuring to swap values:

```js
var x = 10;
var y = 20;

[ y, x ] = [ x, y ]
```

Avoid errors with fallback values:

```js
function data(tmp) {
  return null;
}

var temp;
var [first, , third, ...rest] = (temp = data() || []);
```

##### Object Destructuring

The destructuring pattern goes `source: target = defaultValue`

```js
function data() {
  return {
    a: 1,
    b: 2,
    c: 3,
  };
}

var { a: first = 0 } = data();
```

Use `...` to collect remaining properties into their own object:

```js
function data() {
  return {
    a: 1,
    b: 2,
    c: 3,
  };
}

var { a: first, ...rest } = data();
console.log(rest); // logs { b: 2, c: 3 }
```

We have to wrap the destructuring in `()` if we already declared a variable during destructuring:

```js
function data() {
  return {
    a: 1,
    b: 2,
    c: 3,
  };
}

var first, second;

({ 
	a: first, 
	b: second 
} = data());
console.log(first); // 1
```
